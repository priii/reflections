How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Comparing two files side by side is much easier to find the bug and it saves some time and its not confusing as well.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having all the versions helps to make your work trendy! by comparing the old ones you can actually update and make necessary changes!!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros of manually choosing the commit is sometimes we know the importance of the changes we need which needed to be saved
    cons : As it is a judgement call, it may go wrong/messy  !

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    saving multiple files in one commit can be useful to check what are the files got affected when the changes made

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    $ git log is used to see  all the commits
    $ git diff is used to see the changes made between two particular versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    its easier to find the bugs rather than auditing code line by line

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try commit and diff using gitbash
